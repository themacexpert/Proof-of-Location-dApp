# Proof-of-Location-dApp
Final Project for Truffle University

## Background
The rationale behind this proejct is to be able to irrefutably prove your location at a point in time. There are numerous applications for this, but think along the lines of being able to show proof that you ran a marathon and finished at a certain time, or your hiked a mountain in a record time etc.

## User Stories

### Real Time
As a user I would like to capture my realtime location and upload it. Various metadata should be collected to aid the burden of proof: latitude, longitude, time of day, altitude, etc. 

### Upload
I would like to be able to upload my GPS data captured by popular tracking apps in formats such as geoJSON. I would like to be able to see this data in its entirety (perhaps stored on IPFS) and I would also like to have a hash of this data recorded in the blockchain for proof.
